Download fracture_identification folder from the git repo and put it into your google drive (/content/gdrive/My Drive/fracture_identification/). 
Then you can run a draft notebook "2024_PDDA_ML_competition.ipynb" for fracture detections.
If you have any questions or need clarifications, send an email to "pdda_sig@spwla.org". Thank you!
